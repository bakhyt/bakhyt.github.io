            <p>My name is Bakhyt Bakiyev, and I was born in Uzbekistan. After completing my secondary education, I received a state grant for my bachelor's degree. Driven by my passion for mathematics, I pursued a degree in applied mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics, National University of Uzbekistan, where I successfully graduated with a bachelor's degree. However, as my interest in programming grew, I began exploring opportunities to further my studies in computer science.</p>
            <p>Recognizing India's esteemed reputation in programming, I set my sights on earning a master's degree there. Although I faced setbacks in my first two attempts to secure a scholarship through the Indian Embassy, perseverance eventually paid off. I was awarded a full scholarship from the Indian government to study computer applications at the University of Hyderabad, enabling me to complete my master's degree in computer applications.</p>
            <p>After several years of teaching computer science, my ambition to deepen my knowledge and engage in research intensified. I applied for the prestigious Kazakhstan presidential scholarship, "Bolashak," and was honored to be awarded a full scholarship for another master's degree. This time, I specialized in software engineering at Bauman State Technical University in Russia. This experience not only solidified my technical expertise but also fueled my passion for research.</p>
            <p>To make meaningful contributions to computer science, I sought opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. abroad. In 2021, I was once again privileged to receive the "Bolashak" scholarship, which allowed me to enroll at the University of Birmingham, where I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.</p>

        <section id="progression" class="progression">
            <p>Reflecting on my academic journey, I can clearly observe a consistent progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions, and I am now able to predict my next step—toward a postdoc position. According to the QS World Rankings for 2025, the institutions I have attended are ranked as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>National University of Uzbekistan</b> (781)</li>
                <li><b>University of Hyderabad</b> (801)</li>
                <li><b>Bauman State Technical University</b> (298)</li>
                <li><b>University of Birmingham</b> (80)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using the above rankings, I derived a logarithmic growth model. The general form of the model is:</p>
            <p><b><i>y = a + b * ln(x)</i></b></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>y</b>: Dependent variable (QS World Ranking).</li>
                <li><b>x</b>: Independent variable (academic step).</li>
                <li><b>a</b>, <b>b</b>: Parameters determined by regression analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We calculated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>a = 903.12</b>: Baseline ranking.</li>
                <li><b>b = -519.96</b>: Improvement rate in rankings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The final equation is:</p>
            <p><b><i>y = 903.12 − 519.96 * ln(x)</i></b></p>
            <p>and the graph below illustrates this progression:</p>
            <img src="academic-journey-graph.jpg" alt="Graph showing academic progression with rankings.">
            <p>The <span style="color: blue;">blue points</span> in the above graph represent the actual rankings, while the <span style="color: red;">red line</span> corresponds to the fitted logarithmic growth model, demonstrating a clear progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions. The <span style="color: green;">green point</span> predicts the rank of my next institution (postdoc position), which the model estimates to be <b>66th</b>.</p>
            <p>According to the QS World University Rankings 2025, the 66th position is held by the <b><i>University of Texas at Austin</i></b> in the USA (source: <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-texas-austin">QS World University Rankings</a> 2025).</p>
