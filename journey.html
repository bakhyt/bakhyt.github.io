        <section class="journey">
            <p>My name is Bakhyt Bakiyev, and I was born in Uzbekistan. After completing my secondary education, I received a state grant for my bachelor's degree. Driven by my passion for mathematics, I pursued a degree in applied mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics, National University of Uzbekistan, where I successfully graduated with a bachelor's degree. However, as my interest in programming grew, I began exploring opportunities to further my studies in computer science.
            <p>Recognizing India's esteemed reputation in programming, I set my sights on earning a master's degree there. Although I faced setbacks in my first two attempts to secure a scholarship through the Indian Embassy, perseverance eventually paid off. I was awarded a full scholarship from the Indian government to study computer applications at the University of Hyderabad, enabling me to complete my master's degree in computer applications.
            <p>After several years of teaching computer science, my ambition to deepen my knowledge and engage in research intensified. I applied for the prestigious Kazakhstan presidential scholarship, "Bolashak," and was honored to be awarded a full scholarship for another master's degree. This time, I specialized in software engineering at Bauman State Technical University in Russia. This experience not only solidified my technical expertise but also fueled my passion for research.
            <p>To make meaningful contributions to computer science, I sought opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. abroad. In 2021, I was once again privileged to receive the "Bolashak" scholarship, which allowed me to enroll at the University of Birmingham, where I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.</p>

        <section class="progression">
            <p>Reflecting on my academic journey, I can clearly observe a consistent progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions, and I am now able to predict my next step—toward a postdoc position. According to the QS World Rankings for 2025, the institutions I have attended are ranked as follows: the <b><i>National University of Uzbekistan</i></b> (<b>781</b>), the <b><i>University of Hyderabad</i></b> (<b>801</b>), <b><i>Bauman State Technical University</i></b> (<b>298</b>), and the <b><i>University of Birmingham</i></b> (<b>80</b>). 
            <br/>By analyzing the above rankings, I have derived a logarithmic growth model that illustrates my academic progression:
            <br/><b><i>y = 903.12 − 519.96 * ln(x),</i></b> 
            <br/>and its graph is shown below:</p>
            <img src="academic-journey-graph.jpg" alt="Progression Graph">
            <p>The <span style="color: blue;">blue points</span> in the above graph represent the actual rankings, while the <span style="color: red;">red line</span> corresponds to the fitted logarithmic growth model, demonstrating a clear progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions. The <span style="color: green;">green point</span> predicts the rank of my next institution (postdoc position), which the model estimates to be <b>66th</b>.
            <br/>According to the QS World University Rankings 2025, the 66th position is held by the <b><i>University of Texas at Austin</i></b> in the USA (source: <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-texas-austin">QS World University Rankings 2025</a>).</p>
        <section class="conclusion">
            <p>It is my sincere hope that, with the grace of <b><i>God</i></b>, I will complete my Ph.D. at the University of Birmingham first. I humbly recognize that all plans are subject to <b><i>God's will</i></b>, as the saying goes: <b><i>"Man assumes, and God disposes."</i></b></p>
