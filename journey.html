        <section class="journey">
            <p>My name is Bakhyt Bakiyev, and I was born in Uzbekistan. After completing my secondary education, I received a state grant for my bachelor's degree. Driven by my passion for mathematics, I pursued a degree in applied mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics, National University of Uzbekistan, where I successfully graduated with a bachelor's degree. However, as my interest in programming grew, I began exploring opportunities to further my studies in computer science.
            <p>Recognizing India's esteemed reputation in programming, I set my sights on earning a master's degree there. Although I faced setbacks in my first two attempts to secure a scholarship through the Indian Embassy, perseverance eventually paid off. I was awarded a full scholarship from the Indian government to study computer applications at the University of Hyderabad, enabling me to complete my master's degree in computer applications.
            <p>After several years of teaching computer science, my ambition to deepen my knowledge and engage in research intensified. I applied for the prestigious Kazakhstan presidential scholarship, "Bolashak," and was honored to be awarded a full scholarship for another master's degree. This time, I specialized in software engineering at Bauman State Technical University in Russia. This experience not only solidified my technical expertise but also fueled my passion for research.
            <p>To make meaningful contributions to computer science, I sought opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. abroad. In 2021, I was once again privileged to receive the "Bolashak" scholarship, which allowed me to enroll at the University of Birmingham, where I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.</p>

        <section class="progression">
            <p>Reflecting on my academic journey, I see a consistent progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions and can predict my next step toward a postdoc position. According to the QS World Rankings 2025, the institutions I have attended have the following ranks: the National University of Uzbekistan (781), the University of Hyderabad (801), Bauman State Technical University (298), and the University of Birmingham (80). Using the rankings of these institutions, a logarithmic growth model has been derived. The equation is:</p>
            <p>y=903.12−519.96⋅ln(x)</p>
            <p>The graph below illustrates this progression:</p>

            <p>The blue points represent the actual rankings. The red line represents the above fitted logarithmic growth model, showing a clear progression toward increasingly prestigious institutions. The green point predicts the rank of my next institution (postdoc position), estimated to be 66th based on the model. According to the QS World University Rankings 2025, the 66th position is held by The University of Texas at Austin in the USA (source: QS World University Rankings 2025).</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <p>It is my sincere hope that, with the grace of God, I will complete my Ph.D. at the University of Birmingham first. However, I humbly recognize that all plans are subject to God's will, as the saying goes: "Man assumes, and God disposes."</p>
